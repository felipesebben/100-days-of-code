# Tips and techniques to deal with bugs:
1. **Describe the problem**
If the problem is messy and not well-understood, it is almost impossible to debug it.
Untangle the problem and find what's wrong with it.
* * *

2. **Reproduce the Bug**
Try to describe your problem and then try to see which assumptions that you've made are false.
Occasional bugs are annoying. The important thing is to reproduce that error - when does that error actually happen? Based on that knowledge, fix your code.

3. **Play Computer**
Pretending to be a computer is useful. You can act as the computer, checking how each value is stored in every variable. Then, you compare it with conditional parameters and so on.
* * *

4. **Fix the Errors**
When the editor/console is giving you errors, fix them right away! 
To deal with console errors, you should copy the error and try to look for answers online.
Sometimes, there are no errors, and the code simply does not do what you want it to. Then, you have to fix it by yourself.

5. **Print is Your Friend**
It can help you debug your code.
* * *

6. **Use a Debugger**
Use a breakpoint to tell the computer to stop working at a given line. It allows you to analyse how values are being stored/added to list, and so on.
* * *

7. **Take a Break**
Keep staring at the code won't help. Take a break and come back to it later.
* * *

8. **Ask a Friend**
* * *

9. **Run Your Code Often**
Run it after every litte execution to confirm that your code is doing what you want it to do.

10. **Ask StackOverflow**
