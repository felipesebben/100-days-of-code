# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 3, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Built a simple band name generator program on Python. The user is asked to provide the name of the city in which he or she grew up and the name of his or her pet. The program will store these values and provide a suggestion based on these two inputs.

**Thoughts:** It was nice to review the basics of strings, variables, and logic. These are essential if I want to incorporate a real programming mindset. Logic is still an odd field to me. At the end, though, I managed to build the program in a few minutes with no need to resort to any external support.

### Day 2: March 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Built a simple yet challenging tip generator. The user provides three inputs: the total value of the bill, the tip percentage the user would like to give, and the number of people. The program will then provide the amount each person should pay, including the tip. 
    
I also added a hover feature to a data visualization with plotly concerning recurring earthquakes during 30 days. 

**Thoughts:** It was really challenging to do the tip calculator, as you are asked to think in programming ways. But it was satisfying to see it running and calculating tips left and right!

### Day 2: March 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Built a fun yet challenging tresure hunt game which tested my skills with conditional elements. Basically, the user is asked to make choices along a storyline. Each question leads you to another question or the game is over in case you make the wrong choice. 

**Thoughts**: It was nice to challenge myself by applying logical skills to create the game. It might seem like a simple project, yet you need to plan well ahead your conditionals if you want it to work properly!
