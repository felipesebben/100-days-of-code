# **100 Days Of Code - Log**

## **Day 1: March 2, 2022** 

**Today's Progress**: 
- Built a simple band name generator program on Python. The user is asked to provide the name of the city in which he or she grew up and the name of his or her pet. The program will store these values and provide a suggestion based on these two inputs.

**Thoughts:** 
- It was nice to review the basics of strings, variables, and logic. These are essential if I want to incorporate a real programming mindset. Logic is still an odd field to me. At the end, though, I managed to build the program in a few minutes with no need to resort to any external support.

## **Day 2: March 3, 2022**

**Today's Progress**: 
- Built a simple yet challenging tip generator. The user provides three inputs: the total value of the bill, the tip percentage the user would like to give, and the number of people. The program will then provide the amount each person should pay, including the tip. 
    
I also added a hover feature to a data visualization with plotly concerning recurring earthquakes during 30 days. 

**Thoughts:** 
- It was really challenging to do the tip calculator, as you are asked to think in programming ways. But it was satisfying to see it running and calculating tips left and right!

##  **Day 3: March 4, 2022**

**Today's Progress**:
- Built a fun yet challenging tresure hunt game which tested my skills with conditional elements. Basically, the user is asked to make choices along a storyline. Each question leads you to another question or the game is over in case you make the wrong choice. 

**Thoughts**: 
- It was nice to challenge myself by applying logical skills to create the game. It might seem like a simple project, yet you need to plan well ahead your conditionals if you want it to work properly!

##  **Day 4: March 5, 2022**

**Today's Progress**: 
- Built a series of programs aiming at understanding lists, random numbers and conditionalities. Apart from a treasure map and a coin toss game, built a rock paper scissors game, in which the user plays it with the computer. The user provides a number between 0 and 2, which is stored as either as rock, scissor, or paper. The computer generates a random number between this same range, which must be then stored as the computer's choice between the three possible choices. Then, the two choices are compared, and using conditional elements, the outcome is provided either as a loss, a win or a draw. 

**Thoughts**: 
- It was really nice to build this game. I felt that I was getting the logic of Python while I was building it, and as the days go on, it seems that you get more into this rationale!

## **Day 5: March 6, 2022**

**Today's Progress**: 
- Built a password generator using for loop features. The user is asked to provide a given number of symbols, letters, and numbers, with which the program is supposed to provide a unique password. The program then stores the range of choices in three different variables, which will be used to provide a random group of characters using the `choice()` function in the module `random`. Then, given all the user's choices, the program must shuffle the three groups of characters to provide a harder password.

**Thoughts**: 
- I really like these iteration exercises. They are quite logical and you can use these tools in many ways. One can easily think about using `for` loops as a way to automate similar calculations. The exercises were also very interesting, and worked very well as a complementary way to reinforce learning.

## **Day 6: March 7, 2022**

**Today's Progress**: 
- Solved an escape the maze challenge, in which I was asked to provide an exit strategy for  a robot. Basically, through functions, `while` loops and conditionalities, you needed to guide the robot's oves according to eventual walls and clear paths. 

**Thoughts**: It was a really nice way to learn more about `while` loops. You can see their usefulness when you need to loop through a bunch of commands without a pre-determined list or range of numbers, for instance.

* * *
##  **Day 7: March 8, 2022**
**Today's Progress**: 
- I've managed to build a hangman game in python! It was a 5-step process, in which I had to plan a workflow to be able to implement it. 
- I also advanced on my Tableau course, though I find myself stuck in a particular calculation regarding conditionalities.
- I have also done some SQL queries on a videogames dataset. I have so far managed to learn more about number of releases per year according to each console. I am trying to get unique releases for each console, but it is not as easy as I thought!

**Thoughts**: Seven days have passed by so fast! I must say it is challenging to keep up with the volume of work. But I'm confident that this hardwork will benefit me in the long run. I must sleep more, though.

* * *
##  **Day 8: March 9, 2022**
**Today's Progress**: 
- So far, I've built a caesar cipher. Basically, the user chooses whether he/she wants to encode or decode a given word or sentence that must be provided as an input. Then, a number of shifts in the alphabet must be also given, i.e. if shift equals 2, the encoded message will be provided with an alphabet that is moved two characters write, which means that a would be encrypted as c. The user can encode the message and, if he wants, he can also decode it: he/she must only provide the encrypted message and the number of shifts used in the original encoding.

**Thoughts**: 
- That was a challenging task. It feels sometimes that I will eventually get stuck in one of these projects. I feel compelled to move forward no matter what, a feeling that may not lead to positive outcomes everytime. Well, at, least we are reaching 10% of the course and I can tell that the learning curve is still not that steep!

##  **Day 9: March 10, 2022**
**Today's Progress**:
- Built a silent auction program in python, in which the user could store as many bids made per individual. The project emphasized the use of dictionaries to store the user's input. After all bidders and their respective bids were stored, the program prints the name of the winner, together with his or her bid, which was the highest among the group.
- Also built a series of visualizations based on data obtained from GitHub's API. I've learned how to access API's, store values into empty lists, and then plot a bar chart using plotly.
- I have also using PgAdmin on a daily basis to explore a dataset on games and their respective scores. My idea is to see which consoles have had better scores. I intend to join this table with another with game ratings such as whether or not the game displays nudity and violence scenes etc. 
- I studied Tableau calculations, including field calculations, table calculations, and quick calculations.
- I also move forward with my 2018 Brazil election dataviz project in Tableau.

**Thoughts**: Man, what a day! Lots of things covered. I liked building this silent auction program, as you must deal with pretty interesting python features. The rest was cool too, it was fun playing around plotly's methods, which are endless by the way! I just wish that I could build some nice visualizations faster.

## **Day 10: March 11, 2022**
**Today's Progress**:
- Built a calculator in python. The user is asked to provide a number, the type of operation he or she wants (add, subtract, multiply, or divide), and another number. The program will print the result of the operation, asking whether the user wants to do other operations on the answer. If so, the user can provide another number and operation. If not, the program restarts, asking the user to provide new numbers for a new calculation.

**Thoughts**:
- It was interesting to work with functions while building this program. You can do many things with less lines of code, which makes your coding more elegant and efficient.

 * * *
## **Day 11: March 13, 2022**
**Today's Progress**:
- Built a Blackjack game in python. Just as the actual game, the user chooses to play the game. If he or she indeed does, cards are drawn to the user and to the computer. Then, it is up to him/her to pick another card or see if his/her score is higher than the computer's. Once the game is over, the user can choose to start another one or to finish playing.

**Thoughts**: 
- That was the most challenging project that I've done until now. I had to use many python features, such as for and while loops, functions, conditional statements, indentation, and so on. It was really overwhelming, but it felt nice completing the challenge. Obviously I had to use hints and solutions, yet I believe that if you use these resources actively, i.e. really trying to understand the code and not just copying it, you learn a great deal out of it.

* * *
## **Day 12: March 14, 2022**
**Today's Progress**:
- Studied scope concepts in python, both locally and globally. This was a prerequiste for completing the final project of day 12, in which you're supposed to build a number guessing game.
- Learned more about exploring APIs with python's request module, which allows you to explore and extract data that is automatically generated. Very, very useful!
- Did a DEA on a IGN database of game scores. Actually, just added more queries.
- Studied mapbox studio to develop a custom map about the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

**Thoughts**: 
- This course on 100 days of python feels overwhelming sometimes. You feel like you should follow exactly what the teacher says, but if you do so, it may take you like 300 days to finish it! Python is just one of my interests, so I guess I should take the challenges in a lighter mood. Anyway, I feel like I'm moving forward, which is nice!
- SQL is an area where I don't really know where I'm going - I just make questions, expecting to get better at programming.
- Tableau is my great hope. I really want to get better at it!

* * *
## **Day 13: March 15, 2022**
**Today's Progress**:
- Finished a number guessing game in python. Out of a random number between a 1 to 100 range, the user had to guess numbers; according to the defined level - 'easy' or 'hard' -, the user had either 10 or 5 attempts to guess it. As guesses were stored as input, the program would tell the user whether the number was too low, too high, or correct, which would end the game.
- Finished my 3rd Tableau course (3 out of 5) after I plotted a dual axis map, which contained sales and profit data geographically distributed using size and color to indicate values.
- Almost finished creating my custom Mapbox map for my upcoming Tableau project on the current Russia-Ukraine conflict.
- Explored an IGN videogame dataset with PostgreSQL.
- Studied debugging in python.

**Thoughts**:
- Whew, what a day. Well, building the game from scratch was really challenging (as everything involving python, I guess). Even though I did not build a fully functioning game, I was quite happy with how far I've managed to get. These exercises help you build that logical foundation that I really miss right now.
- The dataviz part is going well. I feel comfortable dealing with this area, but I want to progress even more.
- SQL is an area where I might need to take a look on how to get more skills. I can make queries all day long, but is it enough? So far, I feel like I'm getting better at it.

* * *
## **Day 14: March 16, 2022**
**Today's Progress**:
- Learned more about debugging techniques in Python.
- Started building a Higher Lower game in Python. Basically, the user is given two random Instagram accounts, and they must choose which one has more followers. If the guess is right, another account replaces the lower one, and the user must guess once more, and so on; if the guess is wrong, game over.
- Improved a program designed to access GitHub's repo API, storing tasks within functions. Also, learned how to develop a testing program that makes sure that what is being printed is the actual data.
- Explored two video game datasets with Postgres. Learned how to do nested conditionality and add a new column based on the average of other two columns.
- Finished creating a custom map for my Tableau visualization on the current Russian-Ukrainian conflict. Managed to set the countries labels on the European area, overcoming the issue with Russia being labeled on the center of the country and thus making it too far from Ukraine. Also, managed to set the circles in the map farther from labels, making it more readable. Also, created a nice shape as a refugee symbol.
- Concluded my 3rd course on Tableau!

**Thoughts**:
- Too many. I'm glad that I've been improving my coding skills. Slowly, I feel like I can think how to solve issues in with a programming mindset. I'm a bit lost when it comes to SQL, but I learn something everyday. Finally, my Tableau skills are improving a lot! I hope I can finish my dashboard by the weekend.

## **Day 15: March 17, 2022**
**Today's Progress**:
- Finished building a Higher Lower game in python. 
- Explored GitHub's API with `requests` module. Started exploring repos whose topics contain Ukraine as content, sorted by highest star count.
- Learned more about writing and reading big files with pandas.
- Explored more of the videogame datasets with SQL. Learned a few more tricks on selecting data with more precision.
- Did some work in Tableau by learning about storytelling, the importance of audience, and so on.

- **Thoughts**:
- Not many thoughts today. It was a long day, and I've studied a lot. I'm hungry and I shall eat!

## **Day 16: March 18, 2022**
**Today's Progress**:
- Finished building a Coffee Machine game in python. 
- Explored GitHub's API with `requests` module a little bit more. Started exploring repos whose topics contain Ukraine as content, sorted by highest star count. Still, struggled to plot graphs different than bar charts. Must study plotly's docs.
- Studied SQL by answering precise queries from a really good book. Learned a few more tricks on selecting data with more precision.
- Tried to blend two spatial datasets in Tableau to visualize different phenomena in the same map. Very complicated.

**Thoughts**:
- Very frustrating day. Spent all day studying and it seems that I went nowhere. Well, I guess there are days where you feel like your just stuck in the mud. At least it's the weekend!

## **Day 17: March 19, 2022**
**Today's Progress**:
- Studied Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. Used what I've learnt and rebuilt the Coffee Machine program using classes and methods.
- Managed to plot two different sets of data in the same map in Tableau.

**Thoughts**:
- OOP is fascinating. You can save a lot of code lines with it, and your program looks really elegant and functional. I still need to study more and figure out how to adapt other programs with this line of thinking. 
- It was such a relief for me to be able to plot these data in the same map chart! I still want to add some more data on other parts of Ukraine, such as Luhanks and Donetsk, yet that is something for later on.

## **Day 18: March 20, 2022**
**Today's Progress**:
- Studied classes, methods, and how to add attributes as parameters to the latter. Following the OOP logic,
learned how to store activities within these concepts, which makes your code more elegant and lighter.
- Built a Quiz Project, in which the user is asked to answer 'True' or 'False' to random trivia facts.

 **Thoughts**:
- It was nice to apply what I have learned in terms of OOPs. I still struggle to understand the logic of it, that is, to know what to use, when to use. From tomorrow onwards, I'll review one former day each day, taking notes and redoing some of the exercises and projects.
That will surely help me.

## **Day 19: March 21, 2022**
**Today's Progress**:
- Studied classes and methods using the `turtle` package, which uses Graphical User Interface (GUI) to visualize coding. Having said that, created a million dollar work of art with this lovely package (see link to work!) 
- Studied further steps towards an effective storytelling with Tableau. 
- Practiced SQL queries.
- Managed to create two waffle charts in Tableau.
- Studied Statistics - frequency distribution (absolute and relative)

**Thoughts**:
- It was a rather productive day. Although `python` often feels like an unsurmountable challenge, I must also concede that coding feels lighter and more intuitive as days go by. My fears of while and for loops are slowly fading away, giving way to newer ones, of course!

## **Day 20: March 22, 2022**
**Today's Progress**:
- Studied higher order functions and instances in python. Used these concepts to build an Etch-a-Sketch program using the `turtle` package. Basically, using it's methods and classes, you set the GUI to reproduce a dotted, random-colorized picture, which resembles one of these overpriced pieces of contemporary art.
- Studied storytelling and data preparation in `Tableau`. Learned about the importance of planning ahead how to display data and not to disregard the audience and the stakeholders involved.
- Learned new calculations in `SQL` using a videogame database. 
- Improved the Avocado Analytics dashboard, built using Python's `dash` package. Added user interface and the `dcc.components` function.
- Improved my two dataviz on Ukraine and the 2018 Brazilian presidential elections. Overcame difficult challenges, specially concerning the tile map of Brazil; here, I've managed to transform each tile in a stacked bar of voting percentages.
- Studied `git`'s merging functions.

**Thoughts**:
- That was a rather productive day, nothing to complain.
- Tomorrow, I need to continue working on these two visualizations, as I'm making great progress. I need to study statistics, do SQL exercises, and, if possible, finish the `pandas` course on writing and reading files.

## **Day 21: March 23, 2022**
**Today's Progress**:
- Started building a snake game in Python.
- Studied SQL queries.
- Advanced on my 2018 Elections project by plotting maps with deeper levels of detail.
- Studied statistics. Learned how to plot a histogram after creating a set of absolute frequencies given a number of intervals.

**Thoughts**:
- Nothing to say. A good day.

***
## **Day 22: March 24, 2022**
**Today's Progress**:
- Finished building the snake game in Python.
- Tried to find percentage values in SQL between two sets of categories (not that easy).
- Studied storytelling with Tableau.
- Studied merging conflicting branches in git.
- Finished my avocado analytics dashboard, built with Python's `dash` and put it online using `heroku`.
- Added more in-depth functionalities to my tableau viz on Brazilian elections.

**Thoughts**:
- It feels like despite doing so much, I did so little. But, in a second thought, I guess I am being too harsh with myself. Good things take time. For instance, I've finished one program and one app in a single day - that's gotta count for something, huh? I guess my Tableau skills are what worry me the most. I think too much and do too little. Gotta just do something and deliver something. Oh well, tomorrow is another day.

## **Day 23: March 25, 2022**
**Today's Progress**:
- Built a Pong game in Python.
- Did a bunch of SQL queries focusing on datetime and date columns.
- Plotted a municipality-level map of Brazil's 2018 presidential elections.

**Thoughts**:
- Nothing much. My shift key isn't working and that's really bumming me out.

## **Day 24: March 26, 2022**
**Today's Progress**:
- Built a Turtle Crossing game in Python. The objective is to make the turtle cross a path in which cars (actually, randomly colored rectangles, to be precise) are passing by without getting ran over by.


**Thoughts**:
- It was really fun building this game! It challenged me in many ways. You are asked to think the tasks in a linear way, doing one after the other. It makes you think more orderly - one of the qualities of which I lack the most, I think. But I'm getting there.

* * *
## **Day 25: March 28, 2022**
**Today's Progress**:
- After reviewing how to read, write and add files, rebuilt the Snake Game. Now, the highest score is stored in a separate file, which is loaded every time the program starts, showing the highest score, updating it in case the user sets a new one, which will subsequently be stored as the new highest score.
- Built a Mail Merge program using the writing and reading functionalities. Basically, a list of names was loaded and used with a for loop to create custom letters, each one addressed to a particular name stored in this list.
- Studied statistics. First, measures of central tendency - mean, median and mode. Second, measuring skewness (aka measures of asymmetry)
- Studied intermediate-level SQL queries using SQL Server's Northwind sample database.
- Studied storytelling and started preparing a checklist aimed at identifying the audience, the stakeholders, the goal, the context, and the challenges of a data analysis test.

**Thoughts**:
- Well, another day, another ride. Writing and reading files with python is an important step towards automation, which is something really cool, where the language seems to stand out.
- SQL is fun, definitely one of my favorite languages. As you face more challenging demands, it gets more and more difficult yet attaining a solution becomes also more rewarding.
- Am I in a Tableau plateau? Hope not! These storytelling classes are somewhat out of my comfort zone. Yet, regardless, the key is to tackle issues in small bites.

## **Day 26: March 29, 2022**
**Today's Progress**:
- Learned more about how to read, write, and add contents to `.csv` files. Then - and although this is not a particularly new subject to me -, learned more about using `pandas` to analyse data in python.
- Used this knowledge to analyse a simple dataset on the population of squirrels in NY Central Park.
- Built a US Guess the State game using `pandas` features.
- Studied `SQL` and joined two tables to figure out more about video game ratings and correlations between score reviews.
- Advanced on my Tableau visualization of Ukraine's humanitarian crisis.
- Studied (barely, I must say) merging branches in `git`.

**Thoughts**:
- It was such a great day. Although I'd started it feeling a bit sleepy, after working with in Tableau, things seemed to progress really fast! I feel like this visualization is one of the best I've done so far and that it will help me in my data analysis career.
- Also, I feel like my SQL skills are also improving. The secret is to move forward, just keep swimming and, whenever you get stuck, forget about your anxieties for a moment and remember that soon they'll go away (only to be replaced by new ones!)

***
## **Day 27: March 30, 2022**
**Today's Progress**:
- Learned a great deal about list comprehension with python. Actually, learned about comprehension methods using lists, dicts and pandas dataframes.
- Then, used these new features to improve previous codes, as in the US States game - incredible how you can transform some five lines of code into a single one!
- Built a NATO Alplhabet program, with which the input word is transformed into a list using list comprehension. Then, it is compared with a NATO dict, with returns each letter of the input word in NATO coding.
- Studied skewness in statistics
**Thoughts**:
- Nothing much to say. A normal day.

***
## **Day 28: March 31, 2022**
**Today's Progress**:
- Learned more about functions with many positional arguments (*args) and with many keyword arguments(*kwargs)
- Learned about the tkinter library and all its GUI classes and functions.
- Built a `Miles to KM Converter` using `tkinter`.
- Took my first steps as a data analyst!

**Thoughts**:
- Wow, what a great day! I'm not going to write much about my first work activities - they were all about planning, learning about the company's needs, the context in which it finds itself, and its challenges. Planning is something that should be given A LOT of prep time (duh)!
- Learning and applying GUI concepts feels like moving up in this long, long, long Python learning curve. But it is really nice, because you finally get to see your programming in a nicer, more human, interface. You can see that possibilities become endless, and that you can make your code look in so many different ways!

## **Day 29: April 1, 2022**
**Today's Progress**:
- Built a Pomodoro App in Python!

**Thoughts**:
- Because of my new job, I still need to reorganize my schedule. But I've managed to finish the entire project, and it was quite satisfying! I mean, it is one of my favorite apps. Well, maybe "favorite" is pushing to far, but definitely one the most popular in my list.

## **Day 30: April 2, 2022**
**Today's Progress**:
- It is the thirtieth day of my #100DaysOfCode journey and I've built a GUI password manager. The user can store the name of the website for the password, its user name, and a password; they can either type a password or generate a random version, which is based on [Day 5's password generator](https://github.com/felipesebben/100-days-of-code/blob/master/005_password_generator/password_generator.py).

**Thoughts**:
- Man, I feel like I'm starting to see a silver lining in Python. I mean, I get the logic of behind each challenge quicker, and the solutions pop up faster in my mind. That's gotta be a good sign.

## **Day 31: April 4, 2022**
**Today's Progress**:
- Studied how to handle exceptions and raise errors in Python. The first part dealt with those really exceptional cases in which `if` and `else` statements do not apply, as these happen more often - exceptions are exceptional! Raising errors has more to do about bringing the attention to a given value that numerically - for instance - would not break any rule, yet it would conflict with absurd contexts in reality, for instance. If you don't raise any error in a BMI converter, anyone could type their height as 300m, and the resulting BMI would be absurd for any human being. Therefore, raising errors in these circumstances have more to do with keeping the program functionality in check when inputs are out of a given range or scope. I also changed the NATO alphabet program by raising an error when the user typed any character that was not a letter stored in the program's dict.
- Then, I have learned more about JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files, how popular they are with many applications, and how to read, load, and update data in this format. After that, I used this knowledge to update the Password Manager. I added a "search" button, with which the user could type a website entry to look for the correspondent password - both would pop up in a different window. If this was the user's first time with the app, it would raise an error, as there would be no .json file with data previously created. I had thus to create exceptions that could handle these situations, as well as when the user typed a website name which did not exist in the file.

**Thoughts**:
- Well, quite a busy day! Enough typing, I have so much more to do, and the sun is still up! But I will have to review this content in the near future.

## **Day 32: April 6, 2022**
**Today's Progress**:
- Finished the second capstone project on a Flash Card app.

**Thoughts**:
- Hm, I feel as if I've been lagging behind regarding my python skills. But that should be normal - I'm working now, and time is in short supply. The rule is to move on and try to pick up from where we'd stopped before.

## **Day 33: April 7, 2022**
**Today's Progress**:
- Learned about sending emails with Python by using the `smtlib` module.
- Reviewed the `datatime` module and how to get hold of the year, month, date, and even millisecond of a datetime.
- Built a Birthday Wisher, which automatically sends birthday greetings to whomever is celebrating their birthday on a given date.

**Thoughts**:
- Wow, someone please stop this train, I feel like the world is possible in Python, and I'm not able to get it all.
