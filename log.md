# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 3, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Built a simple band name generator program on Python. The user is asked to provide the name of the city in which he or she grew up and the name of his or her pet. The program will store these values and provide a suggestion based on these two inputs.

**Thoughts:** It was nice to review the basics of strings, variables, and logic. These are essential if I want to incorporate a real programming mindset. Logic is still an odd field to me. At the end, though, I managed to build the program in a few minutes with no need to resort to any external support.
