# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 2, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Built a simple band name generator program on Python. The user is asked to provide the name of the city in which he or she grew up and the name of his or her pet. The program will store these values and provide a suggestion based on these two inputs.

**Thoughts:** It was nice to review the basics of strings, variables, and logic. These are essential if I want to incorporate a real programming mindset. Logic is still an odd field to me. At the end, though, I managed to build the program in a few minutes with no need to resort to any external support.

### Day 2: March 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Built a simple yet challenging tip generator. The user provides three inputs: the total value of the bill, the tip percentage the user would like to give, and the number of people. The program will then provide the amount each person should pay, including the tip. 
    
I also added a hover feature to a data visualization with plotly concerning recurring earthquakes during 30 days. 

**Thoughts:** It was really challenging to do the tip calculator, as you are asked to think in programming ways. But it was satisfying to see it running and calculating tips left and right!

### Day 3: March 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Built a fun yet challenging tresure hunt game which tested my skills with conditional elements. Basically, the user is asked to make choices along a storyline. Each question leads you to another question or the game is over in case you make the wrong choice. 

**Thoughts**: It was nice to challenge myself by applying logical skills to create the game. It might seem like a simple project, yet you need to plan well ahead your conditionals if you want it to work properly!

### Day 4: March 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Built a series of programs aiming at understanding lists, random numbers and conditionalities. Apart from a treasure map and a coin toss game, built a rock paper scissors game, in which the user plays it with the computer. The user provides a number between 0 and 2, which is stored as either as rock, scissor, or paper. The computer generates a random number between this same range, which must be then stored as the computer's choice between the three possible choices. Then, the two choices are compared, and using conditional elements, the outcome is provided either as a loss, a win or a draw. 

**Thoughts**: It was really nice to build this game. I felt that I was getting the logic of Python while I was building it, and as the days go on, it seems that you get more into this rationale!

### Day 5: March 6, 2022**

**Today's Progress**: Built a password generator using for loop features. The user is asked to provide a given number of symbols, letters, and numbers, with which the program is supposed to provide a unique password. The program then stores the range of choices in three different variables, which will be used to provide a random group of characters using the `choice()` function in the module `random`. Then, given all the user's choices, the program must shuffle the three groups of characters to provide a harder password.

**Thoughts**: I really like these iteration exercises. They are quite logical and you can use these tools in many ways. One can easily think about using `for` loops as a way to automate similar calculations. The exercises were also very interesting, and worked very well as a complementary way to reinforce learning.
