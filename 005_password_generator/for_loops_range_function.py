# For loop with Range.
# Range() generates a range of number that you can loop through.

# for number in range(1, 10): # Prints numbers between number and 9!
#     print(number)
# for number in range(1, 101, 3):  # Define steps per number.

# Gauss challenge.
total = 0
for number in range(1, 101):  # Define steps per number.
    total += number

print(total)
